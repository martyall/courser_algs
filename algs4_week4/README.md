===========

This week the assignment was to write a program which solves the n-puzzle: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle
There are three files, Board.java, Solver.java, and MinPQ.java. Board gives the class which represents the state of
the puzzle, Solver solves it using the A* search algorithm, and MinPQ implements the minimal priority queue used in Solver. 
There are also some test files included.
